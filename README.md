# Port_Scanner
This Python port scanner uses the libraries IPy, socket, pyfiglet, and sys.
To use this port scanner, make sure to agree to the disclaimer, without adding any extra characters/spaces.
If you have an IP address (only in IPv4) then pick one of the IP options. If you have a host/domain name such as scanme.nmap.org, then pick one of the hostname options
When picking the option to scan, make sure to pick the number you would like with no extra spaces/characters.
When picking a custom port range, make sure that the beginning port is smaller than the end port, and that the beginning port is greater than or equal to 1.
When picking a common port range, it scans from port 1 to 1024.
At the end of the scan, the program will ask you if you would like more information on the ports that were open during the scan.
This extra port information tells you if your port has encryption, by saying SSH, HTTP, HTTPS. It also tells you the uses of the other ports that might be open and vulnerable/useful.
Make sure to enter everything with no extra spaces/characters or the scanner will not function properly.
